### Hi there, I'm Aoibhe 👋 こんにちは、エーバと申します

- 🔭 I’m currently working on, various new tech investigations, self-improvement, and project management certifications.
- :warning: Headspace: Thanks to decades of previously undiagnosed ADD I have a _lot_ of unfinished, random projects. Some were random explorations of different things, not many should be taken as serious samples of my code. I have a github to track my projects not to show off. I _am_ slowly working on cleaning things out a bit, but it's a low priority so bear with me.
- :transgender_flag: Whois: If you see repos and commits attributed to Jason Wilson, that's also me.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
- ⚡ Fun fact: If you need someone who can code, drive ships, and operate a sonar... I'm your woman.

You can ignore this (or not, I'm a dev not a cop), just want to see if [pages can be linked in this special repo](/test.md).
