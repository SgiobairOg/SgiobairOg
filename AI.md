# AI is Growing in Usage, here is my Stance

While AI has great potential to drive humanity forward, it is subject to human biases and internal issues in the tech community and I've already seen far too many instances where ethics and consideration for the future of humanity have been lacking. AI being treated as a simple tool to generate profit is a very dangerous concept. Therefore I feel the need to make this statement on my position towards AI tech and tech roles.

- If your AI project acts as a force multiplier for all of humanity, if it helps us achieve things we couldn't practically accomplish on our own, if it improves quality of life for all, then I fully support it. I hope you consider to keep ethics and humanity at the forefront of your operations.
- If your AI project is replacing human jobs, if it is build on the questionably obtained or outright stolen ouputs of human beings, if your testing strategy focuses on a single demographic and fails to consider wider humanity, or if you're working with "moving fast and breaking things", I'm sorry, we're not going to see eye-to-eye and I will happily pass on your projects.

I served a number of years on ships at sea. I became very acquainted with situations where risks were needed to achieve important goals. In the sam way I won't take a boat into a rocky shore without a good reason and preparation, I will not be a part of using a technology that could have huge consequences without appropriate planning and consideration. Humanity has enough threats without us building new ones.

Thank you for reading.
